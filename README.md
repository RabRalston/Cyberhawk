# Our task

A wind turbine has 100 items on it, each get inspected. Write an application that outputs numbers from 1 to
100, but for multiples of three print “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the multiples of five
print “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
"Coating Damage and Lightning Strike" instead of the number.

The code to generate the output should be done in PHP and the output should be rendered in HTML with a
nice user experience. Share the code to us and show us what you can do.

# Extra kudos for:

1. A nice UI that makes the most of the output
2. Pulling the inspection data down in an Ajax call and processing the results in the browser
3. Putting the code in GitHub for us to see
4. Getting it to run on a free AWS instance
5. Sharing your plan and approach (any notes you made before coding started)
6. Any future plans for how the application could be improved
